# etl-tnl-alert

**_TODO_** This README needs work. And we should make sure all our ETL scripts
have the same README format.

Repo containing the Epi/HAI ETL for an alert spreadsheet from the Tennesee
Public Health Lab uploaded to the raw Epi/HAI data bucket in CAPE.

The ETL script will extract the tabular data and convert it to a common format
that will then be written into the clean data bucket for later query.

## Raw File Format

**_TODO_** Describe raw file format.

### Column Set

**_TODO_** Add description of expected columns

## Cleaned Format

This section describes the common format that will result from this ETL.

### Column Set

**_TODO_** Add description of expected columns

## Failure Modes

**_TODO_** Add description of ways this script can fail (e.g. no table of
expected raw data, table in wrong location, missing columns, etc.). This will
require better error handling be added to the script.
